I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in Operations Management at the Robert H. Smith School of Business, University of Maryland, affiliated with the [Institute for Trustworthy AI in Law & Society](https://www.trails.umd.edu) and the [Language Science Center](https://languagescience.umd.edu). 
I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Wedad J. Elmaghraby](https://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/directory/wedad-j-elmaghraby). Prior to my doctoral studies, I earned a Master's degree in Applied Statistics from the University of Michigan–Ann Arbor and a dual Bachelor's degree in Financial Management and Mathematical Statistics from Xiamen University.

Research Interests
======
My research centers on the use of artificial intelligence for decision making in operations, with a focus on personalization, prediction, and persuasion. I work at the intersection of marketplace analytics, service operations, and AI for social good---addressing critical issues such as algorithmic fairness, AI copyright infringement, and implicit biases in large language models. Methodologically, I draw on optimization, causal inference, and machine learning---particularly natural language processing---to analyze unstructured data, uncover business insights, and tackle complex operational challenges.
